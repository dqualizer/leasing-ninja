# leasingninja-java-boundedcontexts-domainmodel
The LeasingNinja in Java with DDD style bounded contexts and domain model. UI in Spring WebMVC.

If you haven't visited leasingninja.io yet, should do so now, as its the introduction to the further text.

## Build Instructions

For the time being weâ€™re wrestling with the module system, so we have to play some tricks. It is either:

* build with Maven without tests:

    ```fish
    mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
    ```

* build with Maven without Jigsaw

    ```fish
    bin/enable-jigsaw.sh disable && mvn test && bin/enable-jigsaw.sh enable
    ```
